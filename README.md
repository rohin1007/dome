# Analysis of Wind Flow Around a Curved Building with GASCANS

1. Animation showing flow over a dome in an atmospheric boundary layer using 79 million grid cells. It was modelled using GASCANS, a GPU accelerated LBM-LES based solver and post processed on Paraview . 

2. The difference between instantaneous and time-averaged velocity.
